## Benefits of participating in the Marketplace 

The Marketplace is the launch pad for joint go-to-market activities with Microsoft that can help accelerate your business growth. By using launch promotion, demand generation, and joint sales and marketing, your Marketplace offers can be the centerpiece of your cloud business engine. There are no fees for participating in the Marketplace.

Our goal is to connect Microsoft customers with the best solutions that our partner ecosystem offers. To do that, we support you throughout your journey, from onboarding to publishing and growth. 

Take advantage of the capabilities in the Marketplace to grow your business.

### Expand to new markets and segments and generate new sales opportunities
