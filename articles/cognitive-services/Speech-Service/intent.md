# Sample for intent recognition

Please obtain a subscription key first. In contrast to other services supported by the Cognitive Service Speech SDK, the Intent Recognition services requires a specific subscription key. [Here](https://www.luis.ai) you can find additional information about the intent recognition technology, as well as information about how to acquire a subscription key. Replace your own Language Understanding subscription key, the [region of your subscription](regions.md), and the AppId of your intent model in the appropriate places in the samples.

## Top-level declarations

For all samples below the following top-level declarations should be in place:

[!code-csharp[Top-level declarations](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/csharp/sharedcontent/console/intent_recognition_samples.cs#toplevel)]

[!code-cpp[Top-level declarations](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/cpp/windows/console/samples/intent_recognition_samples.cpp#toplevel)]

[!code-java[Top-level declarations](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/java/jre/console/src/com/microsoft/cognitiveservices/speech/samples/console/IntentRecognitionSamples.java#toplevel)]

## Intent recognition using microphone

The code snippet below shows how to recognize intent from microphone input in the default language (`en-US`).

[!code-csharp[Intent Recognition Using Microphone](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/csharp/sharedcontent/console/intent_recognition_samples.cs#intentRecognitionWithMicrophone)]

[!code-cpp[Intent Recognition Using Microphone](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/cpp/windows/console/samples/intent_recognition_samples.cpp#IntentRecognitionWithMicrophone)]

[!code-java[Intent Recognition Using Microphone](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/java/jre/console/src/com/microsoft/cognitiveservices/speech/samples/console/IntentRecognitionSamples.java#IntentRecognitionWithMicrophone)]

## Intent recognition using microphone in a specified language

The code snippet below shows how to recognize intent from microphone input in a specified language, in this case in German (`de-de`).

[!code-csharp[Intent Recognition Using Microphone In A Specified Language](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/csharp/sharedcontent/console/intent_recognition_samples.cs#intentRecognitionWithLanguage)]

[!code-cpp[Intent Recognition Using Microphone In A Specified Language](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/cpp/windows/console/samples/intent_recognition_samples.cpp#IntentRecognitionWithLanguage)]

[!code-java[Intent Recognition Using Microphone In A Specified Language](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/java/jre/console/src/com/microsoft/cognitiveservices/speech/samples/console/IntentRecognitionSamples.java#IntentRecognitionWithLanguage)]

## Intent recognition from a file, using events

The code snippet shows how to recognize intent in the default language (`en-US`) in a continuous way. This code allows access to additional information, like intermediate results. 
Input is taken from from an audio file, the supported format is single-channel (mono) WAV / PCM with a sampling rate of 16 KHz.
