# Sample for Speech-to-Text

[!include[Get a Subscription Key](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-get-subscription-key.md)]

## Top-level declarations

For all samples below, the following top-level declarations should be in place:

[!code-csharp[Top-level declarations](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/csharp/sharedcontent/console/speech_recognition_samples.cs#toplevel)]

[!code-cpp[Top-level declarations](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/cpp/windows/console/samples/speech_recognition_samples.cpp#toplevel)]

[!code-java[Top-level declarations](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/java/jre/console/src/com/microsoft/cognitiveservices/speech/samples/console/SpeechRecognitionSamples.java#toplevel)]

## Speech recognition using the microphone

The code snippet below shows how to recognize speech input from the microphone in the default language (`en-US`).

[!code-csharp[Speech Recognition Using Microphone](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/csharp/sharedcontent/console/speech_recognition_samples.cs#recognitionWithMicrophone)]

[!code-cpp[Speech Recognition Using Microphone](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/cpp/windows/console/samples/speech_recognition_samples.cpp#SpeechRecognitionWithMicrophone)]

[!code-java[Speech Recognition Using Microphone](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/samples/java/jre/console/src/com/microsoft/cognitiveservices/speech/samples/console/SpeechRecognitionSamples.java#recognitionWithMicrophone)]

## Speech recognition using a customized model

The [Custom Speech Service (CRIS)](https://www.cris.ai/) allows the customization of the Microsoft's speech-to-text engine for your application. The snippet below shows how to recognize speech from a microphone using your CRIS model; fill in your CRIS subscription key and your own deployment identification before running it.

## Continuous speech recognition from a file

The following code snippet continuously recognizes speech input from an audio file in the default language (`en-US`), the supported format is single-channel (mono) WAV / PCM with a sampling rate of 16 KHz.
